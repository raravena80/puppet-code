This module tries to manage apache on different distros in a
similar manner. a few additional directories have to be
created as well some configuration files have to be deployed
to fit this schema.

vhosts can be added with the vhosts define:
(currently only plain vhosts file are supported)

apache::vhosts::file { '$domain' }
